== Creating Representations

Creating a HAL based resource representation is a simple process of calling `newRepresentation` from a configured
`RepresentationFactory`. From here it's a simple matter of using the fluent API to build up your properties, links, and other
resource related details.

[source,java]
----
Representation rep = factory.newRepresentation("/location")
                            .withProperty("name", "Mark Derricutt")
                            .withLink("create", "/api/create");

=== Rendering Representations

Once you've defined your representation instance, you can easily generate the JSON or XML textual representation by calling the
`toString(contentType)` method:

[source,java]
----
String json = rep.toString(RepresentationFactory.HAL_JSON);
----

From here it's just a matter of returning that via whatever web framework you're using.
