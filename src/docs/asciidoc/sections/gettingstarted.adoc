== Getting Started

Usage of the HalBuilder library starts out with an instance of the
`RepresentationFactory` class, this is where you can configure default namespaces and standard links to include on all resource
representations, and of course - create or consume representations.

=== The Representation Factory

[source,java]
----
RepresentationFactory representationFactory = new StandardRepresentationFactory();
----

=== Default Representation URI

The `StandardRepresentionFactory` class is the entry point to HalBuilder, an instance of this
class can be safely reused and injected into the resource classes used by your REST/web framework.

==== Pretty Printing

By default, all representations are generated in a compact format, but can easily be turned into
a pretty printed variation by adding the `RepresentationFactory.PRETTY_PRINT` URI to a factories
flags:

[source,java]
----
representationFactory.withFlag(RepresentationFactory.PRETTY_PRINT);
----
