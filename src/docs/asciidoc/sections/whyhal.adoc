== Representations vs Resources

NOTE: HAL is all about the representation of REST resources, and not the resources themselves.

[source,json]
----
// load from the server?
----

=== Links and Relationships

NOTE: Resources can be navigated by links, relationships identified by the reasons for which we follow a link...

=== Embedding related resources

NOTE: In addition to merely linking to other resources, the HAL format allows you to actually
embed a representation of additional resources directly inside the requested representation.
